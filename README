This is a October 28, 2001 Snapshot of "Wolfenstein 3D Linux" by Steven
Fuller.  It is an unofficial Linux port of the id Software game, Wolfenstein
3D (1992).

I am releasing this snapshot to find out what still needs to be done to make 
this port 'complete.'  So all feedback is welcome.

My Goal:
Take the 1992 DOS game, and bring it to Linux.  Extra features will be kept
at a minimum.

To compile, type: make
Be sure to have SDL 1.2 (http://www.libsdl.org) installed.

To change which version of the game is used, edit version.h (change the
#define WMODE <number> line, replacing <number> with: 0 for the Wolfenstein
3D Shareware (WL1), Wolfenstein 3D registered, all six episodes (WL6), the
Spear of Destiny Demo (SDM), and Spear of Destiny (SOD).  Make sure you have
the latest versions of the game).  Wolfenstein 3D, the first three episodes
(WL3) is not supported; let me know if you have a copy (or you could pick up
a copy of the full version...).  To find out where to get the
demos/shareware, look in NOTES.

Sound support is there.  Edit the Makefile (find the line that has 'OBJS +=
sd_null.o'.  Add a # in front of it, and remove the # from the next three
lines.  Recompile and sound should work.)

If you have anything to contribute to NOTES (interesting facts, etc),
please let me know.

Note:
Config files are not implemented.  They should be implemented in the next
release.
